# Oracle Analysis Module

> **Trigger**: Protocol uses Chainlink, TWAP, Pyth, Band, or any external price feed
> **Inject into**: Lens B (Value/Economic), Lens C (External/Cross-contract)
> **Priority**: HIGH — oracle issues are the #1 source of HIGH/CRITICAL findings in DeFi

## 1. Oracle Inventory

For EVERY external data source the protocol reads:

Chain-specific checks: see the pack's modules/oracle-analysis.md.

**Key question**: What decision does the protocol make based on this data? (pricing, liquidation, reward rate, rebase trigger?)

## 2. Staleness Analysis

For EACH oracle:

| Check | Code Location | Status |
|-------|--------------|--------|
| Max staleness enforced? | | YES/NO |
| Staleness threshold appropriate? | | {seconds} |
| `price > 0` validated? | | YES/NO |

Chain-specific checks: see the pack's modules/oracle-analysis.md.

**If NO staleness check**: Trace impact — stale price used for liquidations? minting? swaps?

## 3. Decimal Normalization

For each oracle → consumer path:
- Oracle returns N decimals. Consumer expects M decimals. Is conversion correct?
- Is `10**decimals()` queried or hardcoded? (Feeds can change decimals on upgrade)
- Multi-hop: If price A is USD/ETH (8 dec) and price B is ETH/TOKEN (18 dec), is the combined calculation correct?

## 4. Manipulation Resistance

- **Spot price**: Can be manipulated via flash loan in same transaction. Is the protocol using spot or time-weighted?
- **TWAP window**: How long? Short TWAP (< 30 min) is still manipulable with sustained capital.
- **Multi-block MEV**: Even TWAP can be manipulated across multiple blocks. What's the cost?

## 5. Failure Modes (WHERE HIGH/CRIT FINDINGS HIDE)

- What if oracle returns 0? Does the protocol revert or use 0 as a valid price?
- What if oracle reverts? Does the protocol have a fallback? Is the fallback itself safe?
- Chain-specific checks: see the pack's modules/oracle-analysis.md.
- **Circuit breaker**: Does the protocol detect extreme deviations? What happens at 50% price drop in 1 block?

## 6. Protocol-Specific Oracle Patterns
<!-- Vectors from pashov/skills (MIT) -->

- **Pyth price staleness**: Pyth prices require explicit `updatePriceFeeds()` call before reading — if protocol reads without updating, price may be arbitrarily stale (unlike Chainlink which auto-updates via heartbeat). Check: is `updatePriceFeeds` called before `getPrice`?
- **Multi-oracle disagreement**: If protocol uses Chainlink primary + Pyth fallback, what happens when they disagree significantly? Attacker can manipulate the cheaper oracle to trigger fallback and exploit the price difference. Check: is there a max deviation threshold between oracles?
- **Oracle price update front-running**: Attacker sees pending oracle update in mempool → executes trade at old price → oracle updates → profit from price delta. Check: can users trade in same block as oracle update? Is there a delay?
- **Wrong price feed for derivative assets**: Using BTC feed for WBTC, ETH feed for stETH, USD feed for USDT — all have depeg risk. Check: does each asset have its OWN price feed, or does it borrow from the underlying?
